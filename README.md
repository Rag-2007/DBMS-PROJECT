# 🏥 Hospital Management System Database

## 📘 Problem Statement

Hospitals manage vast amounts of data every day — including patients, doctors, appointments, lab results, and billing information.  
Manual or poorly structured data handling can lead to **inefficiency**, **human errors**, and **difficulty in performance tracking** and **payment management**.

To overcome these challenges, the **Hospital Management System Database** is developed to **automate and streamline** all hospital operations.  
The system efficiently manages **patient visits, admissions, and billing**, while enforcing **role-based access** for staff to ensure data security and accountability.

It also enables **data-driven performance evaluation** by calculating doctor efficiency using feedback, visit duration, and case volume.  
Using **SQL functions, stored procedures, and triggers**, the system maintains **data integrity, accuracy, and automation** across hospital activities.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Centralized Database Design**  
   Develop a normalized, relational database for managing patients, staff, appointments, and billing efficiently.

2. **Automated Billing System**  
   Use SQL triggers to generate and update billing records in real-time during patient visits.

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
   Restrict operations based on staff roles (e.g., doctors, nurses, lab technicians) to maintain operational integrity.

4. **Doctor Efficiency Tracking**  
   Calculate and monitor doctor efficiency using stored procedures and feedback data for performance-based insights.

5. **Analytical Reporting**  
   Generate analytical insights such as unpaid bill reports and active patient counts to support better hospital decision-making.

6. **Data Accuracy and Automation**  
   Enhance data accuracy, consistency, and performance tracking through SQL-based automation and integrity constraints.
